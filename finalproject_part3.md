## How We Ended Up Here
After taking in the advice and feedback from my interviews, the first thing I did was evaluate my story. I saw where the holes were, and recognized that I needed to explain how the Arts Vibrancy Index correlates with the demographic data that was being presented. There was no real connection, so I put those pieces together before creating anything else. 

The next element I changed was mostly cosmetic. I fixed the sizes of the graphs so that they were readable (changing types of a graphs when needed) and then implemented a more on-theme picture set. Each picture chosen was either surrounding Pennsylvania or the arts, or both. It made everything more cohesive. 
I also changed the color scheme in some areas of the graphs, per feedback from my interviews.

It was when I was changing the color scheme that I actually stopped and thought for a few minutes and realized that I needed to change some of the data. I originally had some nation-wide data for comparison, but then I realized that it was too large of a difference. So, I went back to the data sets and found the information for the state of Pennsylvania instead. This way, the "mental jump" was a lot shorter: going from county to state instead of county to nation. 

I wanted to really drive home that arts vibrancy, at its core, is about community, and about people. I decided to use pull quotes to help this ideas get across, as well as talking about people in every new element I brought up.

The call to action was the easiest thing to do. It crosses from the personal level to the organizational level, and I did that on purpose because I wanted to have my audience recognize that it is going to take action on BOTH levels to really see change.

Speaking of, I did narrow my audience slightly to be art workers, art makers, and art appreciators that reside in the state of Pennsylvania. When I narrowed the data down to only include the state of Pennsylvania, the scope of the audience changed as well. My three intervew people still fall into my audience.
