This is my public portfolio for TSWD at CMU

# About Me
I am a 2nd year Master of Arts Management student, with a concentration in Theatre Arts! I use she/her/hers pronouns, and hope to move to New York City after graduation. I'm originally from Oklahoma, and did my undergrad at the University of Mississippi. Since I am a COVID graduate in the field of the arts, I figured the best thing to do would be going back to school (i.e. spending money) instead of trying to get a job (i.e. making money.) I also am a titleholder in the Miss America program, and compete for the title of Miss Pennsylvania in June!

# What I hope to learn...
I hope to learn how to use data visualization to help consumers understand dense data in easy and managable ways. I hope to go to New York City and be in special events for nonprofits. Being able to showcase the costs for supplies and labor with the vizualization tools I learn in this class will be really helpful!

# Here is where all my cool work will go!
I really do need a job.
