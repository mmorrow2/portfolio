# Madisone E. Morrow Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for TSWD at CMU. There are many like it, but this is mine.

# About Me
I am a 2nd year Master of Arts Management student, with a concentration in Theatre Arts! I use she/her/hers pronouns, and hope to move to New York City after graduation. I'm originally from Oklahoma, and did my undergrad at the University of Mississippi. Since I am a COVID graduate in the field of the arts, I figured the best thing to do would be going back to school (i.e. spending money) instead of trying to get a job (i.e. making money.) I also am a titleholder in the Miss America program, and compete for the title of Miss Pennsylvania in June!

# What I hope to learn...
I hope to learn how to use data visualization to help consumers understand dense data in easy and managable ways. I hope to go to New York City and be in special events for nonprofits. Being able to showcase the costs for supplies and labor with the vizualization tools I learn in this class will be really helpful!

# Here is where all my cool work will go!
I really do need a job.

## Visualization of Government Debt
# Government Debt - North America Highlighted
<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6Bn3" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6Bn3" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2019</a></iframe>
This graph shows general government debt, specifically by looking at the debt-to-GDP ratio in percentages. The lower the ratio, the more likely a country is to be considered financially sustainable. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8567972"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
This is a different visualization for the same data as above. These line charts are showing the change in ratio over time for each country.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8568079"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
This particular visualization pulls out both the datasets for the North American countries as well as the OECD data. I chose the grid bar charts to showcase the changes that the North American Government Debt to GDP ratio compared not only between the three countries, but also over the last ten years. The general trend in the data set shows that the ratio has only grown higher for both Mexico and the United States, while Canada fluxuates. I chose the color because it was not too bright, but still has some color in it. Despite my best efforts, I could not single out a specific country color-wise.

Of these three pieces of data visualization, it is interesting to see the differences that each one is showcasing. In the first graph, it is very much showcasing the difference between each country's ratio, rather than the dates that go along with the data. The intereactive element allows for isolation of specific countries, which I have done for North America and the OECD data. 
In the second vizualization, all of the data is being portrayed. This showcases not only the countries in the dataset against one another (like the previous chart) but against themselves over time. However, this vizualization can be a little overwhelming. The country labels are three letters and not their full names, making the reader have to "figure it out." Each graph's color cannot be changed individually, and therefore makes it harder to highlight certain things. 
The last vizualization is trying to zero in on three countries in particular- those in North America, without looking at the larger picture. However, they are also looking at the OECD's average in relation to these three countries.
