# Part 2

In typical fashion of a graduate student, I have changed my original project that was outlined in Part I. The title of the new project is: "Arts Vibrancy In Pennsylvania" with the subtitle: "How YOU can help your community become more vibrant!" The audience is people who work, who want to work, or who are highly engaged in the visual and performing arts. 
Here is the outline for the new project:

### Intro
Explains what arts vibrancy and the SMU Arts Vibrancy Index is, how it is calculated, and a real-life example for context and engagement.

### Rising Action
The next section of the story will look at the distribution of high and low arts vibrancy areas, overlayed with population, income, and education rates. It will highlight some of the communities that have lower and higher arts vibrancy, and how the aforementioned attributes play a part in the calculations. The data visualizations that will be used will consist of heat maps, bar charts, and scatter plots. 

### Climax
The Climax is the a look at the larger implications of the arts vibrancy scores in both the low and high communities. It will take a look at some (not all) of the social justice issues that are plagueing our society and how it manifests in the arts. These correlations will be shown via pictographas and bar charts.

#### Call to Action
The Call to Action is the subtitle of the project, "How YOU can help your community become more vibrant." It will open the question of how the person reading the article can make efforts to bring more vibrancy to their community, or help keep the vibrancy high.

### Conclusion
The conclusion is the steps for the call to action. There is no "falling action" because I didn't want the reader to lose momentum. There will be 5-6 total ways, falling closely with the SMU Arts Vibrancy calculation categories: Arts Providers, Arts Dollars, Government Support, Socio-economic, and Other Leisure.

## Wireframes/Storyboards
I have chosen to create this element in Shorthand. Click [here] to find my draft. 

There is one data visualization that will not render in Shorthand, and I need to figure out what code to change to fix it. For now, I posted it below.
