# Part 2

In typical fashion of a graduate student, I have changed my original project that was outlined in Part I. The title of the new project is: "Arts Vibrancy In Pennsylvania" with the subtitle: "How YOU can help your community become more vibrant!" The audience is people who work, who want to work, or who are highly engaged in the visual and performing arts. 
Here is the outline for the new project:

### Intro
Explains what arts vibrancy and the SMU Arts Vibrancy Index is, how it is calculated, and a real-life example for context and engagement.

### Rising Action
The next section of the story will look at the distribution of high and low arts vibrancy areas, overlayed with population, income, and education rates. It will highlight some of the communities that have lower and higher arts vibrancy, and how the aforementioned attributes play a part in the calculations. The data visualizations that will be used will consist of heat maps, bar charts, and scatter plots. 

### Climax
The Climax is the a look at the larger implications of the arts vibrancy scores in both the low and high communities. It will take a look at some (not all) of the social justice issues that are plagueing our society and how it manifests in the arts. These correlations will be shown via pictographas and bar charts.

#### Call to Action
The Call to Action is the subtitle of the project, "How YOU can help your community become more vibrant." It will open the question of how the person reading the article can make efforts to bring more vibrancy to their community, or help keep the vibrancy high.

### Conclusion
The conclusion is the steps for the call to action. There is no "falling action" because I didn't want the reader to lose momentum. There will be 5-6 total ways, falling closely with the SMU Arts Vibrancy calculation categories: Arts Providers, Arts Dollars, Government Support, Socio-economic, and Other Leisure.

## Wireframes/Storyboards
I have chosen to create this element in Shorthand. Click [here](https://preview.shorthand.com/TPOI3rBVCld4ayiX) to find my draft. 

This draft took awhile to reach. I knew going into the design what pieces of data I wanted to be visualized, but I often changed the type of graph from my original idea. I also found the way I showcased some of the non-numerical data to be lacking, and therefore went back through and created more interesting visuals for those. I haven't yet put in my theme, but I have found the color scheme I would like to use. It is a pre-packaged one from Flourish, but I find it easy to understand and manipulate.

## User Research Protocol
Target Audience: People who work, who want to work, or who are highly engaged in the visual and performing arts.
Approach: I want to be able to find an array of people who work in the arts. Hopefully I can find people who are both up-and-coming artists/art workers and who are passionate about making a difference. I also want to be able to find people who have been in the industry a little bit longer, and get their feedback on how this research is actually seen in the field.
Interview Script:
1. Read through this and tell me the general theme from it.
2. What would you change about the overall story?
3. How often did you get confused?
4. What places did you lose interest?
5. What places did you gain interest?
6. Were the visualizations clear and/or helpful?

## Interviews

### Interview 1
#### Male, Mid-twentys, Film and theatre worker
Would like more explainations for each section and sub-section. What is it calculating?
Hard time reading the Arts Vibrancy Index graph, maybe make it bigger.
Doesn't fully understand what the data is trying to say. 
The sunburst graph is really visually appealing.
"I can't concentrate, this placeholder image is too stimulating."
"I think there are too many bar graphs."
The Call to Action is really good, and is probably the strongest part. 

### Interview 2
#### Male, thirties, Theatre producer
"SMU Breakdowns take up a lot of space and scrolling. Is there a way to reduce the size or combine them? Maybe like a Prezi, it's in one spot and I can zoom in and out of each section using the next button. Easier to view and use.
I can't read the data subcategories for the Allegheny County wheel. Too small. (I know you can hover over, but at first glance, I don't know what it is and then I have to try and find it in the popup) 
I like the PA map, can that be a bit bigger? More of a showcase?
Population Comparison: I can't read the small bubbles. 
Bar graphs look good and work well for me
I'm sure you'll change the animals to something more relevant.
My final thought is that I want to know how much money is being spent on the arts in PA. I see the demographic data, this is good in showing where arts are needed. But is there a correlation between the demographics and the arts vibrancy scores? If so, what and how does that affect what I can do for the arts?"

### Interview 3
#### Female, early 20s, Visual artist
Really liked the explaination of the data source at the beginning. It made the rest of the article easier to follow and understand. 
The Arts Vibrancy Index sunburt has pretty colors, but the text is way too small. "I honestly can't read it unless I make an effort to scroll over it."
Love the colors on the PA county map. It's clear and makes sense where each county falls in terms of vibrancy.
Would make the vibrancy scores in the three highlighted PA counties bigger/more prominent.
"I can't read the small circles."
"I love the text support, and I think the story is mapped out really nicely."
Need to keep the data colors consistent across the graphs.

## Changes
I need to play around with sizing and see how Shorthand functions a little more to get the right idea across. I also need to figure out how to fully explain the SMU DataArts Arts Vibrancy Index, because even people who have been in the field got a little tripped up by it. Consistency across colors is also needed, and I plan to change the "animals" theme to something more on brand. (The animals were a default.)
