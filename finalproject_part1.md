# Part One of Final Project

## Outline
The goal is to showcase the differences in the levels of engagement between someone's highest level of education and how often they engage with different forms of art. The overall theme is that the more educated someone is, the more likely they are to engage with the arts.

## Data Source
Right now I only have one data source, but I will be using this next week to find supplemental pieces to flesh out my project.
[National Endowment For the Art's Survey on Public Participation In the Arts](/https://www.arts.gov/impact/research/arts-data-profile-series/adp-23)
I plan on using this source because of how extensive the data is. There are clearly laid out methodologies and data tables, and there is more information in this survey than I plan on using. It is an unbiased resource because it is not trying to tell the reader anything other than the results of the survey. This survey was conducted in 2017, so the data is a little old, but still inside the 5 year mark. I believe they wanted to do a new one in 2020, but the pandemic made that an impossibility. 
I am also using this data set because it is from a reputable source. The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) is a government entity that receives approximately $165 million in appropriations and then distributes it to arts and culture organizations throughout the United States through grants.
