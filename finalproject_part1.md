# Part One of Final Project

## Outline
The goal is to showcase the correlation between someone's highest level of education and how often they engage with different forms of art. The overall idea is that the more educated someone is, the more likely they are to engage with the arts. 

### Introduction
Explaination of the arts that the data source is covering and a general methodology.

### Rising Action
This is where more data elements come in, specifically why people engage with the arts in the first place. I'd like to add in elements of tension here, and consistently hint that there is more to come.

This sketch is to show how I will tell the audience how people engage with the arts. I will highlight the top one because (spoiler) it is because people want to spend time with their friends and family. This is where the tension will come in, because I will bring in elements of community and how, in actuality, some communities do not have the option to even engage with the arts.

### Climax 
Looking at amount of education vs. how often someone engages with the arts.

This will be a series of sketches that single out specific forms of art: performing art, visual art/museums, parks and historical exhibits, reading a book, and listening to music. They will all have the highest and lowest highlighted to show the massive disparity betweent the two. 

### Falling Action
Speculation that the reason the higher educated engage more is because they have more money to do so and more time. Data to back this up. This is when the "Telling Stories" element come into play, with bringing in a conflict, and giving the new reality while also giving the call to action.

I wanted to use a scatter plot and potentially a geographic heat map for this section because I believe it will hit people differently depending on where they are currently living and operating. I hope to use this data to really frame the call to action to be something powerful, no matter what the reader identifies with most. 

### Call To Action
People in organizations that have the ability to change things should take a hard look at their programming and recognize that their communities are the most important people to connect with. 

## Data Source
My main data source is the [National Endowment For the Art's Survey on Public Participation In the Arts](https://www.arts.gov/impact/research/arts-data-profile-series/adp-23)
I plan on using this source because of how extensive the data is. There are clearly laid out methodologies and data tables, and there is more information in this survey than I plan on using. It is an unbiased resource because it is not trying to tell the reader anything other than the results of the survey. This survey was conducted in 2017, so the data is a little old, but still inside the 5 year mark. I believe they wanted to do a new one in 2020, but the pandemic made that an impossibility. 
I am also using this data set because it is from a reputable source. The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) is a government entity that receives approximately $165 million in appropriations and then distributes it to arts and culture organizations throughout the United States through grants. 

A secondary piece of data that I will be using is [Southern Methodist University's Arts Vibrancy Map](https://sites.smu.edu/Meadows/ArtsVibrancyMap/). This map showcases the strength of each communityâ€™s Arts Providers, Arts Dollars, Government Support, Socioeconomic, and Other Leisure characteristics. These impacts arts organizations for a variety of reasons, but it also helps me find out if there is a correlation between education and arts dollars.

Another secondary source of data will be from the [2020 US Census](https://www.census.gov/). This information gives insight into demographics by county, which I will use to find information on education levels. 

## Looking Forward
I plan on using Shorthand for my final project. It will have interactive elements from Flourish and Tableau, and be able to function like a website. It will be more engaging than something like a pitch deck, because it will all be contained in one spot without someone having to tap through diffferent slides. 

For the presentation portion, I plan on having a singular slide with the main data points to be projected behind me on the screen. This will give me freedom to move away from the podium and not be stuck having to scroll through anything or have anything need to load.
