# Part One of Final Project

## Outline
The goal is to showcase the correlation between someone's highest level of education and how often they engage with different forms of art. The overall idea is that the more educated someone is, the more likely they are to engage with the arts. 

### Introduction
Explaination of the arts that the data source is covering and a general methodology.

### Rising Action
This is where more data elements come in, specifically why people engage with the arts in the first place. I'd like to add in elements of tension here, and consistently hint that there is more to come. 

### Climax 
Looking at amount of education vs. how often someone engages with the arts.

### Falling Action
Speculation that the reason the higher educated engage more is because they have more money to do so and more time. Data to back this up. This is when the "Telling Stories" element come into play, with bringing in a conflict, and giving the new reality while also giving the call to action.

### Call To Action
People in organizations that have the ability to change things should take a hard look at their programming and recognize that their communities are the most important people to connect with. 

## Initial Sketches



## Data Source
My main data source is the [National Endowment For the Art's Survey on Public Participation In the Arts](/https://www.arts.gov/impact/research/arts-data-profile-series/adp-23)
I plan on using this source because of how extensive the data is. There are clearly laid out methodologies and data tables, and there is more information in this survey than I plan on using. It is an unbiased resource because it is not trying to tell the reader anything other than the results of the survey. This survey was conducted in 2017, so the data is a little old, but still inside the 5 year mark. I believe they wanted to do a new one in 2020, but the pandemic made that an impossibility. 
I am also using this data set because it is from a reputable source. The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) is a government entity that receives approximately $165 million in appropriations and then distributes it to arts and culture organizations throughout the United States through grants. 

A secondary piece of data that I will be using is [Southern Methodist University's Arts Vibrancy Map](/https://sites.smu.edu/Meadows/ArtsVibrancyMap/). This map showcases the strength of each communityâ€™s Arts Providers, Arts Dollars, Government Support, Socioeconomic, and Other Leisure characteristics. These impacts arts organizations for a variety of reasons, but it also helps me find out if there is a correlation between education and arts dollars.
